## BaseballResults

An application to allow users to see MLB team standings ranked by number of
wins. Users can filter the results 3 ways. The MLB selection will display all
data ranked by wins. The Division selection will display data filtered by
division and by league with the teams ranked by wins within that filter. The
League selection will display data filtered by league only with the teams ranked
by wins within each league.
